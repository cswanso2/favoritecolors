Split the project into four projects in a .Net solution. Api, fileProcessor, businessLogic, and unit tests. 

The api is a bit bulkier than I would of liked, hard to pare down the default .NET controller. The entire logic for the api lives in the 
record controller.

Made a console application for the command line file processor. Would have liked to have parsed that down into some more abstractions for user interfaces.

Unit tested where I could. Genrally didn't where it interacted with outside data. IE the files.
